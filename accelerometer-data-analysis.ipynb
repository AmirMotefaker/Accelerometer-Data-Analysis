The data provided by an accelerometer is three-dimensional and can be used in data-driven applications for solving problems like fall detection and health monitoring.\n","\n","- For the task of Accelerometer Data Analysis, we first need to collect data collected by an accelerometer. As an accelerometer collects three-dimensional data, itâ€™s essential to have data about the x, y, and z axes in our dataset with respect to a particular time."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d96fc3c7","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002276,"end_time":"2023-07-26T15:05:02.937284","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T15:05:02.935008","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Import Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"00dd6f30","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-26T15:05:02.944467Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-26T15:05:02.943803Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.795706Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.794749Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.858431,"end_time":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.798468","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T15:05:02.940037","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import plotly.express as px\n","import pandas as pd\n","import plotly.graph_objects as go"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4126c57e","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002173,"end_time":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.803462","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.801289","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Read Data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"8cdf9a6e","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.809823Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.809484Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.912312Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.910996Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.109024,"end_time":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.915022","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.805998","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/accelerometer-dataset/accdata.csv\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"73404381","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.921826Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.921416Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.937472Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.936276Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.021806,"end_time":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.939608","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T15:05:03.917802","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["         Date      Time   accel_x   accel_y   accel_z\n","0  2022-09-03  23:35:16 -1.838747  3.543418  9.126697\n","1  2022-09-03  23:35:31  1.110910  1.810017  9.634268\n","2  2022-09-03  23:35:47  8.829816  0.833182  4.663905\n","3  2022-09-03  23:36:52 -0.852336 -0.124498  9.787497\n","4  2022-09-03  23:37:44 -0.900220 -0.095768  9.835381\n"]}],"source":["print(data.head())"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":12.402227,"end_time":"2023-07-26T15:05:04.763124","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2023-07-26T15:04:52.360897","version":"2.4.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
