The data provided by an accelerometer is three-dimensional and can be used in data-driven applications for solving problems like fall detection and health monitoring.\n","\n","- For the task of Accelerometer Data Analysis, we first need to collect data collected by an accelerometer. As an accelerometer collects three-dimensional data, itâ€™s essential to have data about the x, y, and z axes in our dataset with respect to a particular time."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"22e7c1c5","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.001647,"end_time":"2023-07-26T15:04:31.76182","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T15:04:31.760173","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Import Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"e4dfaa16","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-26T15:04:31.767733Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-26T15:04:31.767198Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-26T15:04:32.699243Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-26T15:04:32.698333Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.938292,"end_time":"2023-07-26T15:04:32.701952","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T15:04:31.76366","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import plotly.express as px\n","import pandas as pd\n","import plotly.graph_objects as go"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":13.40774,"end_time":"2023-07-26T15:04:33.625551","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2023-07-26T15:04:20.217811","version":"2.4.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
