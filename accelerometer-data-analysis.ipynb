The data provided by an accelerometer is three-dimensional and can be used in data-driven applications for solving problems like fall detection and health monitoring.\n","\n","- For the task of Accelerometer Data Analysis, we first need to collect data collected by an accelerometer. As an accelerometer collects three-dimensional data, itâ€™s essential to have data about the x, y, and z axes in our dataset with respect to a particular time."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":9.683601,"end_time":"2023-07-26T14:53:16.520725","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2023-07-26T14:53:06.837124","version":"2.4.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
